Simple Direct\+Media Layer is a cross-\/platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via Open\+GL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve\textquotesingle{}s award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

S\+DL officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, i\+OS, and Android. Support for other platforms may be found in the source code.

S\+DL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available for several other languages, including C\# and Python.

This library is distributed under the zlib license, which can be found in the file \char`\"{}\+C\+O\+P\+Y\+I\+N\+G.\+txt\char`\"{}.

The best way to learn how to use S\+DL is to check out the header files in the \char`\"{}include\char`\"{} subdirectory and the programs in the \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} subdirectory. The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
